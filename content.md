**ABOUT US**

**Rooted in Egypt. Certified for the World.**

**Our company has long standing roots in the agricultural field, enriched with more than 70 years of experience in growing.

**Ismail and Nouran El Meligy have gained extensive and rich experience over the years by working in various areas of the business. Luckily, they were able to absorb Khaled’s unique business philosophy of Nouranto, making them confidently take the transition after the loss of their beloved father to another level of competitiveness while maintaining the company’s integrity codes and values.  It’s all about leadership and dominance in the global market. We have always been special in that, and will always be…**
